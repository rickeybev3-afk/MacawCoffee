# Walkthrough - Macaw Coffee Co. Landing Page

I have built the landing page for Macaw Coffee Co.

## Current Status: Deeply Grounded (Single Version)

After exploring experimental animations and layouts, we have refined the site to a single, cohesive **"Deeply Grounded"** experience.

- **File**: `index.html`
- **Vibe**: Rustic, Dark, Earthy, Artisan, Quietly Soulful.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Hero Video**: Atmospheric background loop.
    - **Navigation**:
        - **Catering & Events**: Direct links to ToastTab inquiry forms.
        - **Shop**: Anchor link to products.
    - **Gallery Section**:
        - **Visual Diary**: A collage-style grid (Masonry feel) showcasing the space and craft.
        - **Interactive**: A minimalistic arrow button expands the gallery to reveal more images smoothly.
    - **Signature Blends**:
        - Features real-world imagery for Colombia, Guatemala, and Decaf Nightcap.
        - Clean, transparent product shots with no background boxes.
    - **Testimonials**:
        - Authentic 5-star Google Review snippets.
        - Rustic card design matching the site aesthetic.
    - **Primary CTA**: "EXPERIENCE THE MENU" (Rainbow Button).
        - Custom CSS implementation of the Magic UI rainbow border effect.
- **Link**: [Open Website](file:///c:/Users/Ricky/Desktop/Coffee%20Website/index.html)

### Technical Notes
- The "Anti-Gravity" files (`antigravity.html`) exist in the project folder but are disconnected from the main navigation.
- All experimental animations (bird, rainbow trails) have been removed.

### Next Steps
1.  **Test Links**: Verify "Catering" and "Events" open the correct ToastTab forms.
2.  **Test Gallery**: Click the arrow in the "Visual Diary" section to see the expansion animation.
3.  **Review Mobile**: Ensure the testimonials stack nicely on smaller screens.
